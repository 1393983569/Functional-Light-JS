Functional Programming (FP) is not a new concept by any means. It's been around almost as long as any programming has been around. I don't know if it's fair to say, but it sure hasn't seemed like as mainstream of a concept in the overall developer world until perhaps the last few years. I think FP has more been the realm of academics.

But that's all changing. There's a groundswell of interest growing around FP, not just at the languages level but even in libraries and frameworks. You very well might be reading this text because you've finally realized FP is something you can't ignore any longer. Or maybe you're like me and you've tried to learn FP many times before but struggled to wade through all the terms or mathematical notation.

Whatever your reason for reading this book, welcome to the party!

We're going to approach FP from the ground up, and uncover the basic foundational principles that I believe formal FPers would admit are the scaffolding for everything they do. But for the most part we'll stay arms length away from most of the intimidating terminology or mathematical notation that can so easily frustrate learners.

I believe it's less important what you call something and more important that you understand what it is and how it works.
