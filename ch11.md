# Functional-Light JavaScript
# Chapter 11: Putting It All Together

By now, you have everything you need to understand functional-light JavaScript. There's no more new concepts to introduce.

In this final chapter, our mail goal is conceptual cohesiveness. We'll look at code that brings many of the major themes from this book together -- application of what we've learned. Above all, this example code is intended to illustrate the "Functional Light" approach to JavaScript -- that is, balance and pragmatism over dogma.

You'll want to practice these techniques yourself, extensively. Digesting this chapter is critical to helping you apply FP principles to your real world code.

## Setup

Let's build a simple stock ticker widget.

**Note:** For reference, the entirety of the code for this example resides in the `ch11-code/` sub directory -- see the GitHub repository for this book (https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS). Also, selected FP helpers we've discussed throughout this book that we need for this example are included in `ch11-code/fp-helpers.js`. In this chapter we will only focus on the relevant parts of the code for our discussion.

First, let's talk about the markup for this widget, so we have somewhere to display our information. We start out with an empty `<ul ..>` element in our `ch11-code/index.html` file, but while running, the DOM will be populated to look like this:

```html
<ul id="stock-ticker">
	<li class="stock" data-stock-id="AAPL">
		<span class="stock-name">AAPL</span>
		<span class="stock-price">$121.95</span>
		<span class="stock-change">+0.01</span>
	</li>
	<li class="stock" data-stock-id="MSFT">
		<span class="stock-name">MSFT</span>
		<span class="stock-price">$65.78</span>
		<span class="stock-change">+1.51</span>
	</li>
	<li class="stock" data-stock-id="GOOG">
		<span class="stock-name">GOOG</span>
		<span class="stock-price">$821.31</span>
		<span class="stock-change">-8.84</span>
	</li>
</ul>
```

Before we go any further, let me remind you: interacting with the DOM is I/O, and that means side-effects. We can't eliminate these side effects, but we can limit and control them. We'll want to be really intentional about minimizing the surface area of our application that deals with the DOM.

In the Chapter 11 example code, in `ch11-code/mock-server.js`, we set up some timers to push out randomly generated fake stock data to a simple event emitter, to emulate as if we were getting messages of stock information from our server. We expose a `connectToServer()` function which pretends to do so, but really just returns the event emitter instance.

**Note:** This file is all fake/mock behavior, so we don't spend much effort trying to make it very FP-friendly. I wouldn't suggest spending too much time concerned with the code in this file. If you wrote a real server -- a very interesting extra credit exercise for the ambitious reader -- you'd want to give that code the FP attention it deserves.

In `ch11-code/stock-ticker-events.js`, we create some observables (via RxJS) hooked up to an event emitter object. We call the `connectToServer()` to get this event emitter, then listen to the event names `"stock"` (adding a new stock to our ticker) and `"stock-update"` (updating the stock's listed price and change amount). Finally, we define transformations on the incoming data of these observables, formatting the data as needed.

In `ch11-code/stock-ticker.js`, we define our UI (DOM side effect) behavior as methods on the `stockTickerUI` object. We also define a variety of helpers, including `getElemAttr(..)`, `stripPrefix(..)`, and others. Finally, we `subscribe(..)` to the two observables that provide us formatted data to render to the DOM.
