# Functional-Light JavaScript
# Chapter 11: Putting It All Together

By now, you have everything you need to understand functional-light JavaScript. There's no more new concepts to introduce.

In this final chapter, our mail goal is conceptual cohesiveness. We'll look at code that brings many of the major themes from this book together -- application of what we've learned. Above all, this example code is intended to illustrate the "Functional Light" approach to JavaScript -- that is, balance and pragmatism over dogma.

You'll want to practice these techniques yourself, extensively. Digesting this chapter is critical to helping you apply FP principles to your real world code.

## Setup

Let's build a simple stock ticker widget.

**Note:** For reference, the entirety of the code for this example resides in the `ch11-code/` sub directory -- see the GitHub repository for this book (https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS). Also, selected FP helpers we've discussed throughout this book that we need for this example are included in `ch11-code/fp-helpers.js`. In this chapter we will only focus on the relevant parts of the code for our discussion.

First, let's talk about the markup for this widget, so we have somewhere to display our information. We start out with an empty `<ul ..>` element in our `ch11-code/index.html` file, but while running, the DOM will be populated to look like this:

```html
<ul id="stock-ticker">
	<li class="stock" data-stock-id="AAPL">
		<span class="stock-name">AAPL</span>
		<span class="stock-price">$121.95</span>
		<span class="stock-change">+0.01</span>
	</li>
	<li class="stock" data-stock-id="MSFT">
		<span class="stock-name">MSFT</span>
		<span class="stock-price">$65.78</span>
		<span class="stock-change">+1.51</span>
	</li>
	<li class="stock" data-stock-id="GOOG">
		<span class="stock-name">GOOG</span>
		<span class="stock-price">$821.31</span>
		<span class="stock-change">-8.84</span>
	</li>
</ul>
```

Before we go any further, let me remind you: interacting with the DOM is I/O, and that means side-effects. We can't eliminate these side effects, but we can limit and control them. We'll want to be really intentional about minimizing the surface area of our application that deals with the DOM.

Summarizing our widget's functionality: the code will add the `<li ..>` elements each time a new-stock event is "received", and will update the price and change as stock-update events come through.

In the Chapter 11 example code, in `ch11-code/mock-server.js`, we set up some timers to push out randomly generated fake stock data to a simple event emitter, to simulate as if we were getting messages of stock information from a server. We expose a `connectToServer()` function which pretends to do so, but really just returns the faked event emitter instance.

**Note:** This file is all fake/mock behavior, so I didn't spend much effort trying to make it very FP-adherent. I wouldn't suggest spending too much time concerned with the code in this file. If you wrote a real server -- a very interesting extra credit exercise for the ambitious reader! -- you'd clearly want to give that code the FP attention it deserves.

In `ch11-code/stock-ticker-events.js`, we create some observables (via RxJS) hooked up to an event emitter object. We call the `connectToServer()` to get this event emitter, then listen to the event names `"stock"` (adding a new stock to our ticker) and `"stock-update"` (updating the stock's listed price and change amount). Finally, we define transformations on the incoming data of these observables, formatting the data as needed.

In `ch11-code/stock-ticker.js`, we define our UI (DOM side effect) behavior as methods on the `stockTickerUI` object. We also define a variety of helpers, including `getElemAttr(..)`, `stripPrefix(..)`, and others. Finally, we `subscribe(..)` to the two observables that provide us formatted data to render to the DOM.

## Stock Events

Let's look at the code in `ch11-code/stock-ticker-events.js`. We'll start with some basic helpers:

```js
function addStockName(stock) {
	return setProp( "name", stock, stock.id );
}
function formatSign(val) {
	if (Number(val) > 0) {
		return `+${val}`;
	}
	return val;
}
function formatCurrency(val) {
	return `$${val}`;
}
function transformObservable(mapperFn,obsv){
	return obsv.map( mapperFn );
}
```

These pure functions should be pretty straightforward to interpret. Recall `setProp(..)` from Chapter 4 actually clones the object before setting the new property. That exercises the principle we saw in Chapter 6: avoiding side effects by treating values as immutable even if they're not.

`addStockName(..)` is used to add a `name` property to a stock message object that's equal to its `id`. The `name` value is later used as the visible stock name in the widget.

A little nuanced note on `transformObservable(..)`: It's ostensibly pure in that `map(..)` on an observable returns a new observable. But technically, under the covers, the internal state of `obsv` is mutated to connect it to the new observable that `map(..)` returns. This side effect isn't really a big deal and won't detract from our code readability, but it's important to spot side effects wherever they are, rather than being surprised by them when you encounter bugs!

When a stock message is received from the "server", it'll look like this:

```js
{ id: "AAPL", price: 121.7, change: 0.01 }
```

Prior to display in the DOM, the `price` needs to be formatted with `formatCurrency(..)` (`"$121.70"`), and the `change` needs to be formatted with `formatChange(..)` (`"+0.01"). But we don't want to mutate the message object, so we need a helper that formats the numbers and gives us a new stock object:

```js
function formatStockNumbers(stock) {
	var updateTuples = [
		[ "price", formatPrice( stock.price ) ],
		[ "change", formatChange( stock.change ) ]
	];

	return reduce( function formatter(stock,[propName,val]){
		return setProp( propName, stock, val );
	} )
	( stock )
	( updateTuples );
}
```

We create the `updateTuples` array to hold both tuples (just arrays) with the property name and the new formatted value, for `price` and `change` respectively. We `reduce(..)` over that array, with the `stock` object as the `initialValue`. We destructure the tuple into `propName` and `val`, and then return the `setProp(..)` call, which returns a new cloned object with the property setting applied.

Now let's define some more helpers:

```js
var formatDecimal = unboundMethod( "toFixed" )( 2 );
var formatPrice = pipe( formatDecimal, formatCurrency );
var formatChange = pipe( formatDecimal, formatSign );
var processNewStock = pipe( addStockName, formatStockNumbers );
```

The `formatDecimal(..)` function takes a number (like `2.1`) and calls its `toFixed( 2 )` method call. We use Chapter 8's `unboundMethod(..)` to create a standalone late-bound method.

`formatPrice(..)`, `formatChange(..)`, and `processNewStock(..)` all use `pipe(..)` to compose some operations left-to-right (recall from Chapter 4).

For creating our observables from our event emitter, we're going to want a helper that's a curried (recall from Chapter 3) standalone of RxJS's `Rx.Observable.fromEvent(..)`:

```js
var makeObservableFromEvent = curry( Rx.Observable.fromEvent, 2 )( server );
```

This function is specified to listen to the `server` (event emitter), and is just waiting for an event name string to produce its observable. We have all the pieces in place now to create observers for our two events, and to map-transform those observers to format the incoming data:

```js
var observableMapperFns = [ processNewStock, formatStockNumbers ];

var [ newStocks, stockUpdates ] = pipe(
	map( makeObservableFromEvent ),
	curry( zip )( observableMapperFns ),
	map( spreadArgs( transformObservable ) )
)
( [ "stock", "stock-update" ] );
```

We start with the array of event names (`["stock","stock-update"]`), then `map(..)` (recall from Chapter 8) that list to a list of two observables, and `zip(..)` (also recall from Chapter 8) that list to a list of observable-mapper functions; this mapping produces a list of tuples like `[ observable, mapperFn ]`. Finally, we `map(..)` that list of tuples with `transformObservable(..)`, spreading out each tuple to individual arguments using `spreadArgs(..)`.

The result is a list of transformed observables, which we array-destructure into the assignments for `newStocks` and `stockUpdates`, respectively.

That's it; that's our FP-Light approach to setting up our stock ticker event observables! We'll subscribe to these two observables in `ch11-code/stock-ticker.js`.

Take a step back and reflect on our usage of FP principles here. Did it make sense? Can you see how we applied various concepts covered across the previous chapters from this book? Can you think of other ways to accomplish these tasks?

More importantly, how would you have done it imperatively, and how do you think those two approaches would have compared, broadly? Try that exercise. Write the equivalent using your well-established imperative approaches. If you're like me, the imperative form will still feel more natural.

What you need to *get* before moving on is that you can *also* understand and reason about the FP-style we just presented. Think about the shape (the inputs and output) of each function and piece. Do you see how they fit together?

Keep practicing until this stuff clicks for you.

## Stock Ticker UI

If you felt pretty comfortable with the FP of the last section, you're ready to dig into `ch11-code/stock-ticker.js`. It's considerably more involved, so we'll take our time to look at each piece in its entirety.

Let's start by defining some helpers that will assist in our DOM tasks:

```js
function isRealDOMElement(val) {
	return val && val.getAttribute;
}
function getElemAttr(elem,prop) {
	return elem.getAttribute( prop );
}
function setElemAttr(elem,prop,val) {
	// !!SIDE EFFECTS!!
	return elem.setAttribute( prop, val );
}
function matchingStockId(id) {
	return function isStock(node){
		return getStockId( node ) == id;
	};
}
function isStockInfoChildElem(elem) {
	return /\bstock-/i.test( getClassName( elem ) );
}

var createElement = document.createElement.bind( document );

var getElemAttrByName = curry( reverseArgs( getElemAttr ), 2 );
var getStockId = getElemAttrByName( "data-stock-id" );
var getClassName = getElemAttrByName( "class" );
```

These should be mostly self-explanatory. I used `curry(reverseArgs( .. ))` (recall from Chapter 3) for `getElemAttrByName(..)` instead of `partialRight(..)`, only to squeeze slightly better performance in this particular case.

Notice that I called out the side effects of setting a DOM element's attribute. We can't as easily clone a DOM object and replace it, so we settle here for a side effect of changing an existing one. At least if we have a bug in our DOM rendering, we can easily search for that code comment to narrow in on likely suspects.

## Summary

The example code we discussed in this chapter is not meant to be prescriptive on exactly how you should write your code. It's meant to draw as many correlations between the concepts of this book as possible. It's meant to explore FP in the context of more "real" code than we typically afford for a single snippet.

I am quite sure that as I learn FP better on my own journey, I will continue to improve how I would have written this example code. What you see now is just a snapshot on my curve. I hope it will be for you, as well.

As we draw the main text of this book to a close, I want to remind you of this readability curve that I shared back in Chapter 1:

<p align="center">
	<img src="fig17.png" width="600">
</p>

It's so important that you internalize the truth of that graph and set realistic expectations for yourself on this journey to learn and apply FP principles to your JavaScript. You've made it this far, and that's quite an accomplishment.

But don't stop when you dip towards that trough of despair and disenchantment. What's waiting on the other side is a way of thinking about and communicating with your code that's more readable, understandable, verifable, and ultimately, more reliable.

I can't think of any more noble goal for us as developers to strive towards. Thanks for sharing in my journey to learn FP principles in JavaScript. I hope your's is rich and hopeful, too!
