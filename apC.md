# Functional-Light JavaScript
# Appendix C: FP Libraries

If you've been reading this book from start to finish, take a minute to stop and look back how far you've come since Chapter 1. It's been quite a journey. I hope you've learned a lot and gained insight into thinking functionally for your own programs.

I want to close this book leaving you with some quick pointers of working with official FP libraries. This is not an exhaustive documentation on each, but a quick glance at the things you should be aware of as you venture beyond "functional-light" into true FP.

Wherever possible, I recommend you *not* reinvent any wheels. If you find an FP library that suits your needs, use it. Only use the ad hoc helper utilities from this book -- or invent ones of your own! -- if you can't find a suitable library method for your circumstance.
