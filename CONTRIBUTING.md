Please feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PR's for improvements to code snippets, explanations, etc. If there's any doubt or if you think that a word/phrase is used confusingly, **before submitting a PR, open an issue to ask about it.**

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book, as I (and any future publisher) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but I just have to make sure the lawyers are happy by explicitly stating it.

This book will go through official editing eventually, and typos will likely all be caught at that stage. As such, **typos are not a big concern of mine for now**. If you're going to PR for typo fixes, please be measured in doing so by collecting several small changes into a single PR (in separate commits). Or, **just don't even worry about them for now,** because we'll get to them later. I promise.

Also, if you have any questions or concerns, please make sure to search the issues (both open and closed!) first, to keep the churn of issues to a minimum. I want to keep my focus on writing the book as much as possible.
